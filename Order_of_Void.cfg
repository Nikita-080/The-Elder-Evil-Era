   description=_"Veterans of the Royal Guard still remember the legends of the mysterious paladins of the Northern Citadels. The story goes that back in the time of Haldrick II, an unprecedented invasion of the undead took place in the capital. The mighty heroes were supposed to protect the people, but... failed. They had nothing to match the crushing magic of the warlocks. The city was burning, and the barely surviving remnants of the brotherhood could do nothing. Unable to bear the shame, they retreated to their stronghold and vowed to relentlessly improve the art of war, so that on the fateful day they would return and end dark magic forever. Since then, no one knows where the paladins went. Even their Strongholds were gone, as if they had never existed. But now everything has changed. Thousands of automatons of the Iron Legion are coming out of the mountains. Countless Blood Cults are active in the forests and swamps. The dead are waking up in abandoned castles. In this dark age, they came from the east. In shining white robes, in shining armor, they call themselves the Order of the Void and they have come to redeem themselves. It seems that the oath has not been forgotten, the paladins of the order destroy hordes of unholy creatures, despite the terrifying numerical superiority of the enemy. No less surprising is the fact that the order avoids alliances with any other military forces, preferring to fight away from prying eyes. Armies of enemies are always exterminated to the last fighter. Even random squads of humans or elves who came to the noise of the battle to help never return... Evil tongues say that in order to achieve military power, paladins resorted to mysterious forces that they are not even able to understandâ€¦"
