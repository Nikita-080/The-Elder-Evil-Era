   description=_"Centuries ago, when the Wesnoth kingdom was not yet on the maps, a terrible event happened. Dwarves have long been forging magical artifacts for themselves and for the Elven lords. However, some of the dwarf blacksmiths decided that dark sorcery could also be used. Retreating into abandoned tunnels, they laid the foundations for what they would later call the Path of Fire. Here, in the darkness of the depleted mines, they began experiments. And they succeeded. It wasn't a blade that revived the dead, or a staff that created whirlwinds of fire. They created a mechanical semblance of life. An incredible array of gears, pistons and hinges intertwined with each other. The creature could move clumsily and even hold a weapon. And then, the secret forge was revealed. The lords of the dwarf people were enraged by the manifestation of witchcraft they saw, and disowned their brethren. The apostates had to run, run even further, into caves under volcanic mountains. Strangely enough, the blacksmiths were followed by ordinary dwarves, adepts of the Path of Fire. No one has seen them since. The dwarf lords hoped that these heretics had perished from the clutches of unknown underground creatures or from the vagaries of restless mountains. But one day, everything changed. Combat automatons began to emerge from the caves. Hundreds and thousands of mechanical creatures. Slow and unwieldy, but possessing strong armor and superhuman strength, they terrified entire armies in the blink of an eye. Among them, you can see dwarves in scorched armor and with axes that sparkle with lightning bolts of magical energies. Together they call themselves the Iron Legion."
