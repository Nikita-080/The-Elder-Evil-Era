   description=_"It has long been known that a student of magic risks becoming a victim of dark and dangerous forces. Most often, fallen wizards become necromancers. They have harnessed the dead, their flesh, their bones, even their souls. Undead invasions are a long-standing and ongoing problem. But there are other dark arts. One of these is the disgusting magic of blood. Its adherents have not been heard of for many hundreds of years. Few ancient manuscripts claim that blood magicians gathered entire cults of followers around them, and then hunted down and enslaved ordinary people. The fate of these unfortunate people remained an unsolved mystery, but strange and hostile creatures began to appear in places where cults operated. No one could have imagined that Blood Cults existed all this time, but they skillfully hid their actions under the guise of orc raids. But now they have gained strength and are ready to reveal themselves to the world. They want to enslave all humans and destroy other races. The first battles with the royal army also gave the first information about the new enemy. It is known from the captured grimoires that the Patriarchs of all the Northern cults want to get together and conduct a mysterious ritual of the Red Sky. It seems that this is why they are collecting thousands of slaves and this could be the end of the Wesnoth kingdom."
